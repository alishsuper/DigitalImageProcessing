An implementation of two famous edge detectors
===================

## 1. Canny edge detector

#### Description


The Canny edge detector uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works.

#### Steps Involved
- Apply Gaussian filter to smooth out the image
- Find intensity gradients from given image
- Apply non-maximum suppression to remove spurious response to edge detection
- Apply double threshold to determine potential edges
- Track edge by hysteresis: finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges (not done)

#### Motivation

John Canny's paper on 'A Computational Approach to Edge Detection' [ https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55e6/6333402df1a75664260501522800cf3d26b9.pdf ]

#### How to run
-------------

This program depends on the following packages:

 - Matplotlib
 - Skimage
 - Numpy
 - mpl_toolkits

Clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adl1995/edge-detectors.git
```
To execute the script, type:
```python
python marr-hildreth-edge.py
```

## 2. Marr Hildreth


#### Description

Marr Hildreth algorithm finds edges in digital images where there are strong and rapid variations in image brightness. The Marrâ€“Hildreth edge detection method operates by convolving the image with the Laplacian of the Gaussian function, or, as a fast approximation by Difference of Gaussians. Then, zero crossings are detected in the filtered result to obtain the edges.

#### Steps Involved

- Apply Gaussian filter to smooth out the image
- Find zero crossings

#### Motivation

Hildreth's paper on "Theory of edge detection" [ http://www.hms.harvard.edu/bss/neuro/bornlab/qmbc/beta/day4/marr-hildreth-edge-prsl1980.pdf ]
